### Improvements:
Fixed text alignment in numerous places
Fixed the tall buttons to make them a reasonable size
Reformatted the publication page; left-aligned text, removed overly verbose/large header labels. Information is presented in a more minimalist/intuitive way.
Reformatted the blog page and fixed text alignment
Didn't add a detail page for two reasons:
1. Professor Bebbington likes it; most of their posts are less than 500 words, which doesn't need a dedicated page. A dedicated page might look empty and in many cases would have the first 250 words as a summary, and upon clicking it, would show the same content plus another 50 words, which would be redundant.
2. I wanted to show off a bit and use JS to show/hide the comments rather than making another static page.
