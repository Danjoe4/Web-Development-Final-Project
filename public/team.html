                                        southeastern Arizona, and mapping forest types in Massachusetts using
                                        multi-season Landsat data. Dr. Rogan received his Ph.D. (Geography) degree from

                                        His work analyzes data from multiple sources to measure, model, and describe
                                        ecological properties and processes over space and time, drawing inferences
                                        about the functioning and governance of socio-environment systems. Primarily
                                        drawing on remote sensing, GIS, and data science as methods, he investigates
                                        disruption to communities driven by climate change and localized impacts of
                                        extractive and infrastructure development. Much of his past and current research
                                        has purposefully engaged with international civil society and legal groups such
                                        as Oxfam America, Oxfam Honduras and the Center for Climate Crimes Analysis. He

                                        is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Environmental Studies at the College of the Holy
                                        Cross (Worcester, MA) and a Research Scientist with Extractives@Clark. She
                                        completed her PhD in 2019 with a dissertation project that examined how
                                        international climate policy influences forest governance in Indigenous
                                        territories and community lands in Central America. Another line of inquiry
                                        examines how extractive industries and infrastructure expansion implicate
                                        community rights and resource conflict, particularly in rural areas. She works
                                        closely with civil society and Indigenous Peoples organizations, especially the
                                        Regional Research Program on Development and Environment (PRISMA) and
                                        Mesoamerican Alliance of Peoples and Forests (AMPB), and these collaborations
                                        have shaped her research agenda. Prior to undertaking a PhD, she served for five
                                        years in the Office of International & Tribal Affairs of the United States
                                        Environmental Protection Agency. She holds a BA in International Relations and
                                        in Environmental Science & Policy from the College of William & Mary and an
                                        MPhil in Development Studies from the University of Oxford.
